\section{Manual Upgrade}

\begin{warning}
    Manual upgrade is not supported.

    The OpenChat Zimlet and Extension are upgraded during the the Zimbra upgrade.

    Any modification to the installed zimbra packages or to the database may lead to a fail during the Zimbra upgrade.
\end{warning}

This chapter will guide the administrator through the manual upgrade of the OpenChat.

\subsection{Common tasks}

    Get and build the sources as described in the \autoref{sect:buildfromsrcs}. After the build the installed packages
    can be replaced following the same steps as the installation described in \autoref{sect:installpkgs}.

\subsection{From Zimbra 8.7.6}
    \subsubsection{Upgrade the database}

        The default OpenChat database schema was created in \verb+latin1_swedish_ci+, the administrator MUST convert it to \verb+UTF-8+

        To verify the collation of the database run this command:
        \begin{verbatim}
# As zimbra
mysql <<\EOF
  SELECT `DEFAULT_COLLATION_NAME`
    FROM information_schema.SCHEMATA
    WHERE SCHEMA_NAME=`chat`;
EOF
        \end{verbatim}

        If the current collation name is \verb+latin1_swedish_ci+ migrate the tables running this command:
        \begin{verbatim}
# As zimbra
mysql <<\EOF
  ALTER SCHEMA `chat`
    DEFAULT CHARACTER SET `utf8`
    DEFAULT COLLATE `utf8_general_ci`;
  USE `chat`;
  ALTER TABLE `USER`
    CONVERT TO
        CHARACTER SET `utf8`
        COLLATE `utf8_general_ci`;
  ALTER TABLE `RELATIONSHIP`
    CONVERT TO
        CHARACTER SET `utf8`
        COLLATE `utf8_general_ci`;
  ALTER TABLE `EVENTMESSAGE`
    CONVERT TO
        CHARACTER SET `utf8`
        COLLATE `utf8_general_ci`;
EOF
        \end{verbatim}
