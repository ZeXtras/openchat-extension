Stress tests are being perfomed on the product.

We have noticed an increment of the workload stimabe at most 7\% in an Zimbra installation with 20000 users.

The most impacting part of the OpenChat Zimbra Extension is made by the history feature. When a message is sent, a mime
message is either created or updated, meaning few kilobytes are read or written and some database queries are performed.

    We suggest to disable history in very large deployments, to edit the configuration see \ref{==sect:confkeys==}.
