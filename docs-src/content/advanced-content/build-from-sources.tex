\section{Build from sources}
\label{sect:buildfromsrcs}

This section will guide the administrator through the steps to build the OpenChat Extension and Zimlet.

The official Zimbra OpenChat source repository is hosted on \href{https://www.github.com/ZeXtras/OpenChat}{GitHub.com/ZeXtras/OpenChat}.

\subsubsection{Prepare the system}
    The build of the OpenChat Zimlet and Extension is tested against this specific dependencies:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A network connection to download the sources and the required software
        \item Git 2.7+
        \item Java 8
        \item Node 6 (with nvm 0.32+)
        \item Apache Ant 1.9+
        \item GNU Make 4+
        \item GCC 4.8
    \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Build the packages}
    The build system uses relative path.
    This example assume the working path is \verb+/tmp/+, if You want to perform the build on another path please change
    the path accordingly to Your needs.
    \begin{verbatim}
# Clean the folder we will be using for the build
rm -rf /tmp/OpenChat && cd /tmp/
# Clone the source repository
git clone --recursive git@github.com:ZeXtras/OpenChat.git
# Jump into the source folder
cd OpenChat
# Checkout the correct branch for the Zimbra release (assuming Zimbra 8.7.6 )
git checkout release/8.7.6
# Build the whole package (can take some minutes)
make
    \end{verbatim}

    The final artifacts will be placed in this order:
