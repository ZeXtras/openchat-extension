\section{Manual Uninstallation}

\begin{warning}
    Manual uninstallation is not supported.
    Please consider to disable the Zimbra OpenChat (see \autoref{sect:confkeys}) instead of uninstalling it.

    Any modification to the installed zimbra packages or to the database may lead to a fail during the Zimbra upgrade.
\end{warning}

This chapter will guide the administrator through the manual uninstallation of the OpenChat and
the cleanup the system.

\subsection{Remove the packages}

# As zimbra
zmzimletctl undeploy com_zextras_chat_open

    \end{verbatim}

    Once the packages are removed a mailbox restart is required to fully unload the extension:
    \begin{verbatim}
# As zimbra
zmmailboxdctl restart
    \end{verbatim}

\subsection{Cleanup the Database}
    To completely clean the Zimbra database, drop the Zimbra OpenChat table:
    \begin{verbatim}
# As zimbra
mysql <<EOF
    DROP DATABASE chat;
EOF
    \end{verbatim}
